About:
  The purpose of this project is to automate several processes one is likely to encounter in a linear algebra course. 

  Eventually this project is intended to serve as a full linear algebra library, with a focus on aiding students of linear    
  algebra.

Current Features:
  (1) Reduces a random or custom matrix given a user's command
  (2) Reduces a matrix directly to reduced row echelon form
  (3) Transpose and norm of a matrix
