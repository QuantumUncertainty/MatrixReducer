## MatrixTools
MatrixTools is a linear algebra library equipped with a basic user interface to aid students of linear algebra. The project is currently in progress, but includes a number of useful features. The program allows the the user to interactively reduce a matrix using Gaussian elimination or jump directly to reduced row echelon form. Other linear algebra operations are implemented such as norms, trace, matrix multiplication, and transpose. Matrix decompositions and other features are in progress. For fun, This program was built from the ground up. I wanted/want to implement as many features and algorithms myself as possible.

## Language and Tools (Current)
- Java 8
- IntelliJ IDE
- JUnit 5

## Planned Improvements
- Matrix inverse
- Determinant
- QR Decomposition
- Eigen Decomposition
- GUI
- More tests

## Author
This program was built by me, Tucker Bullara. I'm a senior at UL Lafayette studying computer science and mathematics.
